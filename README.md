ekkokammer

hosted on ZEIT NOW
run 'now --target production' to deploy
Remember to check alias settings after deploy. I'm not sure how it works

Using improvmx.com for email forward. All going to ianabildskou@gmail.com atm
Domain was bought at domain.com. I probably have to renew it at some point

First had ekkokammer.band as domain, but many social networks do not allow .band domains.
Recently got ekkokammer.org domain also
